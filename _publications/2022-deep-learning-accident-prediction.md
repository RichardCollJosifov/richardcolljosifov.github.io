permalink: /publication/2022-deep-learning-accident-prediction
excerpt: 'In this paper, YOLOv4 neural networks are trained on a dataset, VisDrone, that is firstly validated through a custom-made graphic user interface. Several tests have been undertaken to compare these models to other previously existing models.
The trained models are then used to detect and classify in real-time objects in a street to then be used by an algorithm to first track them, then calculate their trajectories and finally predict potential collisions between them.'
