About me
======
<p class="text-justify">

Hi, I am a first year MSc student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I am specializing in "Mathematics of Data Science". I intend to do a PhD once I finish my MSc, in particular in the areas of mathematical statistics, applied mathematics and the mathematical foundations of machine learning.  <P></p>
<p class="text-justify">
Before the masters I completed a four year BSc in Electrical Engineering focusing in Systems, Control and Robotics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain, graduating first of the 2021/2022 promotion. I did my bachelor's thesis about deep learning based computer vision for aerial view street object detection and classification, which led to a publication at the conference "Jornadas de Automática 2022" organized by the Spanish Automatic Control Comitee.
