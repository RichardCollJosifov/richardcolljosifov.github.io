About me
======
Hi, I am a first year MSc student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. I will be specializing in "Mathematics of Data Science". 

Before that I completed a four year BSc in Electrical Engineering focusing in Systems, Control and Robotics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain graduating first of the 2021/2022 promotion. I did my bachelor's thesis about deep learning based computer vision for aerial view street object detection and classification, which led to a publication at the conference "Jornadas de Automática 2022" organized by the Spanish Automatic Control Comitee.

I am interested in applied mathematics and its relation to machine learning and data science.
