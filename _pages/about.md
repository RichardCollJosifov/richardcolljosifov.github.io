About me
======
Hi, I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student focusing in Systems, Control and Robotics. I am currently undertaking my bachelor's thesis (24ECTS) in deep learning based computer vision for street object detection and classification.

I am interested in machine learning and data science, and specifically in the mathematics behind these, as well as in the applications of artificial intelligence to robotics.
